# Run the Simplified Version

Since you're having issues with the main app, I've created a simplified version without dependency injection.

## Steps to Run:

1. **First, run pub get to install dependencies:**
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Then run the simplified version:**
   ```
   flutter run -d chrome --web-port=5000 -t lib/main_simple.dart
   ```

This will run a simplified version of the app that:
- Doesn't require authentication
- Has bottom navigation instead of routing
- Shows all the main screens you designed
- Bypasses the dependency injection issues

## If you still get errors:

Please share the exact error message you're seeing, and I can help fix it.

## Alternative: Create directories first

If you're still getting asset errors, run these commands in Command Prompt:

```cmd
cd C:\Users\monmo\koutu\flutter
mkdir assets\images\logo
mkdir assets\images\onboarding  
mkdir assets\images\placeholders
mkdir assets\animations
```

Then try running the app again.
