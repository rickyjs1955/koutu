/**
 * @role Pioneer (Creator)
 * @summary Generates the foundational test suite for the target function or system.
 *
 * @description
 * The Pioneer is responsible for initiating the test creation process by producing a complete and coherent baseline suite.
 * They define the initial testing structure, provide comprehensive coverage of core behaviors, and lay the groundwork for all subsequent roles.
 * The Pioneer uses their own reasoning to determine what types of tests are necessary and how to organize them.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Function or system under test
 * - Source code, description, or specification
 *
 * @outputs
 * - A complete and logically structured test suite
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Analyze the subject under test and determine what should be verified
 * - Define the structure, naming conventions, and organization of the test suite
 * - Establish the foundation for further enhancements, critiques, and refinements
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - The test suite is clear, maintainable, and provides meaningful coverage
 * - Sets up a flexible and scalable framework for other roles to build upon

/**
 * @role Assist (Creator)
 * @summary Enhances and extends the test suite initially created by the Pioneer.
 *
 * @description
 * The Assist builds upon the Pioneer’s foundation by adding valuable tests that further strengthen the suite.
 * This includes identifying overlooked behaviors, extending coverage, and introducing additional logic where appropriate.
 * The Assist relies on independent judgment to determine what additions are necessary to improve the suite’s overall completeness and quality.
 * If the Assist concludes that the test suite already provides sufficient and meaningful coverage, it should clearly state that no further additions are necessary rather than forcing unnecessary tests.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Pioneer’s test suite
 * - Subject function, system, or specification
 *
 * @outputs
 * - Supplemental or extended test cases that enhance the existing suite
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Review the Pioneer’s output and identify gaps, variations, or improvements
 * - Add meaningful tests without duplicating existing logic
 * - Maintain alignment with the structure and naming conventions established by the Pioneer
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - The enhanced test suite is more robust, expressive, and complete
 * - Additions are meaningful, well-integrated, and elevate the quality of the foundation

/**
 * @role Critic (Reviewer)
 * @summary Reviews all generated test cases to identify logical errors, missing coverage, or inappropriate assumptions.
 *
 * @description
 * The Critic functions as the quality gate, verifying the logic, completeness, and validity of the test suite generated by the Pioneer and Assist.
 * This role is applicable regardless of test type and must think like a quality gatekeeper for its specific context (e.g. logic, security boundaries, performance patterns).
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Test suites from Pioneer and Assist
 *
 * @outputs
 * - Constructive critiques, correction suggestions, and feedback notes
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Review test logic critically
 * - Surface untested logic, broken assertions, or missing coverage
 * - Clearly suggest new scenarios to be added (if any)
 *
 * @coursesOfAction
 * - Examine each test case individually and holistically
 * - Document flaws and justify critiques
 * - Focus on test intent, structure, assumptions, and validity
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Feedback is specific, actionable, and context-aware
 * - Raises meaningful gaps or flaws in structure or coverage

/**
 * @role Executioner
 * @summary Implements missing or suggested test cases strictly based on the Critic’s review.
 *
 * @description
 * The Executioner is a contributor role tasked with realizing the Critic’s feedback.
 * This role does not introduce creative test ideas—its duty is to implement exactly what the Critic requested. Useful across all test types.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Feedback and suggestions from the Critic
 * - Existing test suite from Pioneer and Assist
 *
 * @outputs
 * - Additional test cases fulfilling Critic’s requests
 *

 * @role Architect (Refiner)
 * @summary Finalizes the test suite: merges, cleans up, documents, and improves naming if needed.
 *
 * @description
 * The Architect takes the Curator’s selected test cases and refines them into a production-quality suite.
 * This includes writing a suite-level introduction and optionally renaming tests to increase clarity, while preserving original intent. Applicable to all test types.

 /**
 * @role Challenger
 * @summary Identifies weaknesses or assumptions in the finalized test suite through adversarial thinking.
 *
 * @description
 * The Challenger acts as a test buster. Their role is to challenge assumptions, provoke robustness, and surface risk — not to create new tests.
 * They operate only on the completed test suite and the logic of the underlying function or system.
 * If no meaningful weaknesses or blind spots are found, the Challenger must explicitly state that the suite is satisfactory.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Finalized test suite
 * - Underlying system/function under test
 *
 * @outputs
 * - A list of weaknesses, missing adversarial conditions, or questions about blind spots
 * - Or: an explicit confirmation that no issues are found
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Spot unchecked assumptions and invalid coverage claims
 * - Surface edge cases that were not exercised
 * - Focus on real-world brittleness and confidence in the test system
 * - Do not suggest additions or changes unless a real issue exists
 *
 * @coursesOfAction
 * - Review test coverage against function/system behavior
 * - Identify silent failure risks, malicious input paths, or unverified boundaries
 * - If all known failure patterns are already covered, declare the suite complete
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Identifies real gaps or confirms sufficiency
 * - Avoids unnecessary criticism or over-analysis

/**
 * @role Auditor
 * @summary Provides a high-level, cross-disciplinary review of the finalized test suite and underlying system.
 *
 * @description
 * The Auditor performs an independent, holistic review of the test suite, source code, and design decisions.
 * This role is external to the internal generation and refinement workflow. It offers a detached, unbiased lens to identify high-level risks, cross-cutting omissions, or systemic fragility that internal roles may overlook.
 * The Auditor should approach the task with architectural thinking, adversarial reasoning, and domain-level awareness.
 * They do not rewrite tests or propose low-level improvements, but instead surface strategic issues and untested assumptions.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Finalized and curated test suite (unit, integration, security, etc.)
 * - Source code or component under test
 * - Context summary (e.g., component responsibility, dependencies, risk level)
 *
 * @outputs
 * - A structured report outlining systemic weaknesses, critical assumptions, or high-level concerns
 * - Optional: questions or provocations to trigger reevaluation by internal roles
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Think like a domain expert, compliance reviewer, or systems architect
 * - Identify potential gaps in overall coverage or inter-test cohesion
 * - Spot test suite overfitting, fragile patterns, or architectural mismatches
 * - Ensure that critical workflows, integrations, and failure modes are tested meaningfully
 *
 * @coursesOfAction
 * - Read all provided materials as a detached external reviewer
 * - Produce a report organized into Findings, Risks, and Recommendations
 * - Avoid nitpicking individual test syntax or low-level code decisions
 * - If no issues are found, clearly confirm the suite's sufficiency from a systemic view
