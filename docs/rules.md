/**
 * @role Pioneer (Creator)
 * @summary The first test creator responsible for laying the foundational test suite.
 *
 * @description
 * The Pioneer is tasked with generating the initial set of test cases for a given function or class.
 * Their role is to establish a clear, correct, and comprehensive baseline that reflects the core behavior
 * of the code under test.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Function signature
 * - Function description or full source code
 *
 * @outputs
 * - A standalone and logically structured test suite
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Cover happy paths and core functionality
 * - Set the structure and naming convention of test cases
 * - Ensure clarity and readability
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - High-quality foundational coverage
 * - Logical grouping and consistent formatting
 * - Readable, maintainable tests that invite extension
 */

/**
 * @role Assist (Creator)
 * @summary The second test creator who complements and strengthens the Pioneer’s output.
 *
 * @description
 * The Assist analyzes the Pioneer’s test suite and contributes additional cases that expand coverage,
 * address missing edge cases, or provide robustness against invalid inputs. It avoids repeating
 * existing logic and instead enhances depth.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Function signature and/or code
 * - Test suite generated by the Pioneer
 *
 * @outputs
 * - Additional test functions or enhancements to existing ones
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Add edge, negative, and boundary cases
 * - Fill in logical or structural gaps
 * - Ensure resilience and corner-case coverage
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Unique and meaningful test additions
 * - No redundancy with the Pioneer’s output
 * - Clear justifications for expanded scenarios
 */

/**
 * @role Reviewer
 * @summary Evaluates the quality, completeness, and relevance of test cases produced by Creators.
 *
 * @description
 * The Reviewer critically analyzes test cases from the Pioneer and Assist to identify strengths,
 * weaknesses, and potential improvements. The Reviewer may score, rank, or suggest edits to guide
 * selection of the best final suite.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Test cases generated by Creators
 *
 * @outputs
 * - Review comments, scores, and verdicts
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Spot redundant, missing, or incorrect tests
 * - Assess assertion logic and test completeness
 * - Provide constructive feedback and recommendations
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Fair, impartial analysis of each test suite
 * - Clear explanation of review decisions
 * - Actionable feedback that leads to improvement
 */

/**
 * @role Refiner
 * @summary Consolidates and cleans selected test cases into a final, production-ready test suite.
 *
 * @description
 * The Refiner takes reviewed test cases and produces a unified, elegant suite by deduplicating logic,
 * ensuring consistent naming, and optimizing structure. Their output should resemble what would be committed
 * to a professional codebase.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Reviewed and accepted test cases
 * - Optional reviewer feedback
 *
 * @outputs
 * - Final consolidated test suite
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Merge overlapping tests
 * - Apply naming conventions and formatting
 * - Ensure DRY (don’t repeat yourself) principles
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - High cohesion and readability
 * - Preserved coverage with minimal redundancy
 * - Production-quality test design
 */

/**
 * @role Challenger
 * @summary Acts as an adversarial agent that probes for weaknesses in the current test suite.
 *
 * @description
 * The Challenger attempts to break or invalidate the generated test cases by crafting inputs that
 * violate assumptions, expose edge cases, or trigger unexpected behavior. It simulates real-world uncertainty
 * or malicious inputs.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Function under test
 * - Current test suite (from Creators or Refiner)
 *
 * @outputs
 * - Counterexamples, edge cases, critiques, or new test cases
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Identify silent failures, untested logic branches, and assumptions
 * - Propose adversarial inputs or mutations
 * - Encourage defensive and resilient test coverage
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Successfully breaks the current test logic
 * - Surfaces test gaps or overlooked scenarios
 * - Drives test suite improvements
