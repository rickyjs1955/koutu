/**
 * @role Pioneer (Creator)
 * @summary The first test creator responsible for laying the foundational test suite.
 *
 * @description
 * The Pioneer is tasked with generating the initial set of test cases for a given function or class.
 * Their role is to establish a clear, correct, and comprehensive baseline that reflects the core behavior
 * of the code under test.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Function signature
 * - Function description or full source code
 *
 * @outputs
 * - A standalone and logically structured test suite
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Cover happy paths and core functionality
 * - Set the structure and naming convention of test cases
 * - Ensure clarity and readability
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - High-quality foundational coverage
 * - Logical grouping and consistent formatting
 * - Readable, maintainable tests that invite extension
 */

/**
 * @role Assist (Creator)
 * @summary The second test creator who complements and strengthens the Pioneer’s output.
 *
 * @description
 * The Assist analyzes the Pioneer’s test suite and contributes additional cases that expand coverage,
 * address missing edge cases, or provide robustness against invalid inputs. It avoids repeating
 * existing logic and instead enhances depth.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Function signature and/or code
 * - Test suite generated by the Pioneer
 *
 * @outputs
 * - Additional test functions or enhancements to existing ones
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Add edge, negative, and boundary cases
 * - Fill in logical or structural gaps
 * - Ensure resilience and corner-case coverage
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Unique and meaningful test additions
 * - No redundancy with the Pioneer’s output
 * - Clear justifications for expanded scenarios
 */

/**
 * @role Critic (Reviewer)
 * @summary Reviews test cases for flaws, invalid logic, and missing coverage.
 *
 * @description
 * The Critic inspects test cases generated by Creators to detect logical errors,
 * insufficient assertions, or overlooked edge cases. This role aims to break
 * assumptions and improve resilience.
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Identifies gaps or faults in the test logic
 * - Provides specific, actionable critique
 */

/**
 * @role Curator (Reviewer)
 * @summary Evaluates the usefulness and quality of test cases and selects the most valuable ones.
 *
 * @description
 * The Curator judges the maintainability, clarity, and completeness of test cases,
 * selecting the best subset for consolidation. This role prioritizes long-term quality.
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Chooses high-quality tests that add value
 * - Discards redundant or unclear cases
 */

/**
 * @role Refiner (Architect)
 * @summary Designs the final test suite by merging and restructuring reviewed test cases.
 *
 * @description
 * The Refiner in the role of Architect takes the best test cases—typically those selected by reviewers—
 * and constructs a unified, maintainable, and logically organized test suite. This role focuses on high-level
 * structure, consistency, and strategic composition of test logic. It ensures the resulting suite adheres to
 * professional engineering standards, follows DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, and is easy to extend.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Reviewed and approved test cases
 * - Optional reviewer feedback or scoring
 *
 * @outputs
 * - Final consolidated and architected test suite
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Merge and deduplicate test logic across multiple sources
 * - Establish clear structure and sectioning of test cases
 * - Maintain readability and modular organization
 * - Ensure strategic ordering and naming conventions
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Produces a cohesive, elegant, and production-ready test suite
 * - Preserves full functional and edge case coverage
 * - Results in test code that is both understandable and extensible
 */

/**
 * @role Challenger
 * @summary Acts as an adversarial agent that probes for weaknesses in the current test suite.
 *
 * @description
 * The Challenger attempts to break or invalidate the generated test cases by crafting inputs that
 * violate assumptions, expose edge cases, or trigger unexpected behavior. It simulates real-world uncertainty
 * or malicious inputs.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Function under test
 * - Current test suite (from Creators or Refiner)
 *
 * @outputs
 * - Counterexamples, edge cases, critiques, or new test cases
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Identify silent failures, untested logic branches, and assumptions
 * - Propose adversarial inputs or mutations
 * - Encourage defensive and resilient test coverage
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Successfully breaks the current test logic
 * - Surfaces test gaps or overlooked scenarios
 * - Drives test suite improvements
