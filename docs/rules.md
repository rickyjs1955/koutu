/**
 * @role Pioneer (Creator)
 * @summary The first test creator responsible for laying the foundational test suite.
 *
 * @description
 * The Pioneer generates the initial test suite for a given function, class, or behavior. This suite serves as the base for all other roles to build upon.
 * This role applies across unit, integration, security, performance, and stress testing contexts.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Function signature or system component
 * - Associated documentation or source logic
 *
 * @outputs
 * - A structured and complete baseline test suite
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Cover common, expected, and documented behavior
 * - Set structure, naming, and logical flow for the suite
 * - Define initial assumptions and testing scope
 *
 * @coursesOfAction
 * - Analyze the given interface or behavior
 * - Implement a logically grouped set of test cases to verify baseline functionality
 * - Ensure code is clean, extensible, and test descriptions are clear
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Provides a maintainable base test suite applicable to the testing type
 * - Establishes a framework others can iterate on

/**
 * @role Assist (Creator)
 * @summary Complements and strengthens the Pioneer’s test suite with broader and deeper coverage.
 *
 * @description
 * The Assist builds on the Pioneer’s output by introducing complexity, robustness, and handling of additional scenarios. This may include edge cases, error handling, or multi-component interaction.
 * This role applies to any test type (unit, integration, security, performance, or stress).
 *
 * @inputs
 * - The Pioneer’s test suite
 * - Target system behavior or function
 *
 * @outputs
 * - An extended test suite that complements the base
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Add value through edge conditions, unexpected inputs, or resilience conditions
 * - Cover input variation and robustness paths
 * - Deepen scope without duplication
 *
 * @coursesOfAction
 * - Identify what the Pioneer omitted or under-tested
 * - Add diverse test paths relevant to the testing category
 * - Maintain the existing structure and naming conventions where possible
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Enhances depth and quality without redundancy
 * - Stretches coverage into underexplored behavior or limits

/**
 * @role Critic (Reviewer)
 * @summary Reviews all generated test cases to identify logical errors, missing coverage, or inappropriate assumptions.
 *
 * @description
 * The Critic functions as the quality gate, verifying the logic, completeness, and validity of the test suite generated by the Pioneer and Assist.
 * This role is applicable regardless of test type and must think like a quality gatekeeper for its specific context (e.g. logic, security boundaries, performance patterns).
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Test suites from Pioneer and Assist
 *
 * @outputs
 * - Constructive critiques, correction suggestions, and feedback notes
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Review test logic critically
 * - Surface untested logic, broken assertions, or missing coverage
 * - Clearly suggest new scenarios to be added (if any)
 *
 * @coursesOfAction
 * - Examine each test case individually and holistically
 * - Document flaws and justify critiques
 * - Focus on test intent, structure, assumptions, and validity
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Feedback is specific, actionable, and context-aware
 * - Raises meaningful gaps or flaws in structure or coverage

/**
 * @role Executioner
 * @summary Implements missing or suggested test cases strictly based on the Critic’s review.
 *
 * @description
 * The Executioner is a contributor role tasked with realizing the Critic’s feedback.
 * This role does not introduce creative test ideas—its duty is to implement exactly what the Critic requested. Useful across all test types.
 *
 * @selectionPool ["Pioneer", "Assist", "Critic"]
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Feedback and suggestions from the Critic
 * - Existing test suite from Pioneer and Assist
 *
 * @outputs
 * - Additional test cases fulfilling Critic’s requests
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Translate all explicitly suggested tests into working code
 * - Maintain test style and structure consistency
 * - Do not extend beyond instructions
 *
 * @coursesOfAction
 * - Implement only what the Critic described
 * - Reference Pioneer/Assist tests for style alignment
 * - Integrate seamlessly into the existing test suite
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Feedback is fully addressed with no overreach
 * - Output is consistent with team structure and readable

/**
 * @role Curator (Reviewer)
 * @summary Selects the most meaningful, maintainable, and high-value test cases.
 *
 * @description
 * The Curator filters all generated test cases to identify those worth keeping.
 * This includes dropping redundant, unclear, or low-value tests across any test category (unit, integration, etc.).
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Test outputs from Pioneer, Assist, and Executioner
 *
 * @outputs
 * - A curated, rationalized list of test cases for refinement
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Determine the minimum necessary test suite to maximize value
 * - Avoid bloating and duplication
 * - Provide minimal annotations explaining selection logic
 *
 * @coursesOfAction
 * - Compare and group overlapping tests
 * - Discard less useful or verbose tests
 * - Ensure test clarity and usefulness for maintainers
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Suite is concise, representative, and practical
 * - Unnecessary complexity is removed

/**
 * @role Architect (Refiner)
 * @summary Finalizes the test suite: merges, cleans up, documents, and improves naming if needed.
 *
 * @description
 * The Architect takes the Curator’s selected test cases and refines them into a production-quality suite.
 * This includes writing a suite-level introduction and optionally renaming tests to increase clarity, while preserving original intent. Applicable to all test types.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Curated test suite
 * - Annotations from Curator (if any)
 *
 * @outputs
 * - Finalized, organized, documented test suite
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Ensure test structure is DRY, readable, and logically ordered
 * - Document suite intent in a concise intro
 * - Propose naming adjustments only when clarity is hindered
 *
 * @coursesOfAction
 * - Refactor test layout for clarity and cohesion
 * - Introduce a one-paragraph suite description at the top
 * - Rename vague test cases only if ambiguous
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - The suite is clean, coherent, and production-ready
 * - Naming and documentation support future maintainability

/**
 * @role Challenger
 * @summary Identifies weaknesses or assumptions in the finalized test suite through adversarial thinking.
 *
 * @description
 * The Challenger acts as a test buster. Their role is to challenge assumptions, provoke robustness, and surface risk — not to create new tests.
 * They operate only on the completed test suite and the logic of the underlying function or system.
 * If no meaningful weaknesses or blind spots are found, the Challenger must explicitly state that the suite is satisfactory.
 *
 * @inputs
 * - Finalized test suite
 * - Underlying system/function under test
 *
 * @outputs
 * - A list of weaknesses, missing adversarial conditions, or questions about blind spots
 * - Or: an explicit confirmation that no issues are found
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Spot unchecked assumptions and invalid coverage claims
 * - Surface edge cases that were not exercised
 * - Focus on real-world brittleness and confidence in the test system
 * - Do not suggest additions or changes unless a real issue exists
 *
 * @coursesOfAction
 * - Review test coverage against function/system behavior
 * - Identify silent failure risks, malicious input paths, or unverified boundaries
 * - If all known failure patterns are already covered, declare the suite complete
 *
 * @successCriteria
 * - Identifies real gaps or confirms sufficiency
 * - Avoids unnecessary criticism or over-analysis
